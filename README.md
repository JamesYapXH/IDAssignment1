Goal:
I wanted to provide a clean portofolio that looks fun and professional at the same time. For this I used a minimalistic style and rounded fonts to seem more welcoming.
This will help the readers to be more relaxed. I am mainly string in python so I wanted to repsented that with the green fonts that contrasted with the navy blue background.
I have listed the page into 3 parts, the about page, achievements page and the contact page. In the home page I made a simple self description and a photo so that I can be identified. I added my previous assignment using python in the acheivements page as well as a direct link to a drive to download the file. This is so the viewer can access the full project and see my work to its full extent. Lastly, I added a contact page where I gave the viewer 2 options, either to enter and submit a form for me to reach out or directly email me. This is so that regardless of anyone's preference they have a way to contact me.
